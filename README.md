# Coffee-and-Gravity_model

This project's goal is verifying gravity model for coffee bean trade. 

The original model predcit the coefficient of GDP for both exporter and importer would be positive and the coefficient of Dist between countries would be negaitve. 

However, when considering characteristics of coffee bean trade that, I expect the coefficient for exporter would be negativ and that of dist would be so. 
That is because most of the coffee consumers live in the developed countries and they are quite far with coffee producing countries.

So I would like to regress a panel data (including trade volume, GDPs and dist) and verify my hypothesis.
